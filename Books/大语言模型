What is RNN?
It's called a recurrent neural network
It can deal with different amounts of input values.
Feedback loops

Three kinds of frames
1): Encoder-only: Two-way attention mechanism, good for natural Language Understanding (Let the computer think like a human)
2): Decoder-only: Delete the encoder portion in the Encoder_decoder parts, decrease the calculating complexity of the model,
                  It's good for an unconditional text generation task
3): Encoder-Decode: Add a decoder to the basic frame, good for generating tasks with conditions.

Frame of Encoder-only
It's Bidirectional Encoder Model (comprehensive attention mechanism)
